1. What is it
==============
Is action real-time game full of creatures and bonuses.
You can go through levels, kill creatures using bombs and imvrove yourself
collecting bonuses.
The Bombic 2 offers also cooperative mode up to 4 players on one computer,
and deathmatch on one PC.

2. Dependencies
================
There are some libraries, that should be installed in.

2.1 SDL
--------
Bombic 2 - the game - needs SDL (Simple DirectMedia Library)
and its sublibraries installed. Please follow instructions at http://libsdl.org
to install SDL, SDL_ttf, SDL_image.

2.2 Agar
---------
Bombic 2 - the game - needs AGAR library for its menu.
I distribute agar-1.3.3 a little pached with it.
For installation please go to the game/libs/agar like this
 $ cd game/libs/agar
unpack and configure it using prepared configure file
 $ ./configure
compile and install it
 $ make && make install

If you are not the root or you cannot install it to your system
you can use --prefix option of ``make install'' to install it anywhere you want.
But don't forget specify in game/Makefile path to executable ``agar-config''
if it isn't in $PATH.

2.3 Qt
-------
Map editor for Bombic 2 uses Qt library.
If you plan compile also the map editor, please install the Qt SDK
according to http://qt.nokia.com/products.

3. Configuration
=================
If your ``agar-config'' is not in path (try ``where agar-config'')
define absolute path to it in game/Makefile.

Now please open the main Makefile and fill in some variables.
DESTDIR - absolute path, where you want to install
INSTALLDIR_DEFINE - definition of macro that holds absolute path
	of installed data. Let it be if you are planning install
	the game or map-editor. If you are not, let define here
	something else (for instance DEFAULT_INSTALL_DIR) and let the
	macro INSTALL_DIR undefined to point data relatively from binary.
	In that case you mustn't install or uninstall it.

4. Compilation and installation
================================
Now simply type
 $ make
for compile the game only or
 $ make all
for compile the game and map editor too.
If you configured INSTALLPATH into INSTALL_DIR you can install it typing
 $ make install
